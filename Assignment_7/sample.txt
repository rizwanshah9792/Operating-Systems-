Create two C programs:
program1.c → Reads the file first.
program2.c → Reads the file only after program1 reads it.
Use Semaphore to control the order and synchronize both programs.
If program1 runs n times, program2 should read the file exactly n times, not more.
Finally, remove the semaphore properly.
